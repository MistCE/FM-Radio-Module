_**Overview**_

This project demonstrates the creation of a functional FM radio using the TEA5756 FM module, Arduino Due, Rotary Encoder, OLED Display, Audio Amplifier, and a speaker. 
The system was designed to tune into radio frequencies, display station information, and output sound through the speaker.

_**Features**_

FM Tuner: Allows users to tune into FM radio stations using a Rotary Encoder.
OLED Display: Displays the current radio frequency in real-time.
Audio Amplification: Outputs clear audio through an amplifier and speaker.
User Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for tuning stations.

_**Components**_

**Arduino Due**: The microcontroller used for handling inputs and managing communication between components.
**TEA5756 FM Module**: Used for receiving FM radio signals.
**Rotary Encoder**: Enables users to adjust the radio frequency.
**OLED Display**: Shows the current frequency being tuned.
**Audio Amplifier**: Amplifies the audio output from the FM module.
**Speaker**: Outputs the audio.

_**Software**_

The project was developed using C++ to handle hardware interaction and signal processing.

_**Schematic & Workflow**_

I used Tinkercad and MS Paint to create the system's schematic.
The project planning and functional breakdown were organized using a flowchart, outlining how the radio operates and interacts with the user.
